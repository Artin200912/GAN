# GAN Network for Fashion Image Generation

This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate fashion images based on the MNIST Fashion dataset. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. The goal of this project is to train a GAN model that can generate new fashion images, showcasing the potential of GANs in creative applications such as fashion design, art, and more.

## Features

- **GAN Architecture**: Utilizes a GAN architecture to generate fashion images from the MNIST Fashion dataset.
- **Image Generation**: The ability to generate new fashion images that resemble the training dataset.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of the generated images for comparison with the original dataset.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the GAN implementation)
- Matplotlib for image visualization

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Artin200912/GAN.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
